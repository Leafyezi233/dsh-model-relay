/**
 * Group scheduling: the order a group's candidates are tried in, and how many
 * times one candidate is retried after a rate limit.
 *
 * Two orthogonal axes, deliberately not four enum values:
 *
 *  - `strategy` orders the candidates.
 *  - `retry429` decides how many times ONE candidate is retried before the
 *    next is tried.
 *
 * The settings page offers four presets, which are just combinations:
 *
 *   A sequential          = { strategy: 'sequential',  retry429: 0 }
 *   B balanced            = { strategy: 'round-robin', retry429: 0 }
 *   C random              = { strategy: 'random',      retry429: 0 }
 *   D sequential + retry  = { strategy: 'sequential',  retry429: N }
 *
 * Keeping them apart is what lets "balanced, plus retry" exist at all; folding
 * them into one enum would force every ordering branch to duplicate the retry
 * logic, and would make that combination unrepresentable.
 *
 * Every ordering returns a PERMUTATION of the candidate list, never a subset.
 * A member that is merely deprioritized stays reachable, so a scheduling
 * choice can never shorten a group's fallback chain.
 *
