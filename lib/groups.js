/**
 * Persistent model-group store for the OpenAI gateway.
 *
 * A group is a named list of models the gateway already exposes. A caller that
 * names the group gets the first candidate that answers; the rest are
 * fallbacks. Routing *within* a group is the order of that list plus two
 * scheduling knobs. There are deliberately no conditions and no weights.
 *
 * ## Two kinds of group
 *
 * A group carries an explicit `kind`, and the kind decides what its candidate
 * list may hold:
 *
 *  - `model` (the default, and what every group written before this existed
 *    is): every candidate is a concrete model. A candidate that names another
 *    group is REFUSED, because resolving it would silently flatten that group
 *    to its first leg and drop its scheduling.
 *  - `composite`: every candidate is `dsh-model-relay_<group>`, naming a
 *    `model` group. Dispatching such a candidate hands it back to this same
 *    gateway through DSH's own llm service, so the inner group runs its OWN
 *    strategy and retry budget rather than being flattened.
 *
 * The kind is a stored field rather than a naming convention on purpose. A name
 * prefix is a rule a user satisfies by accident — any group called
 * `nested-foo` would silently become able to contain groups — and it leaves
 * "is this a group or a model?" undecidable without a lookup. A field answers
 * that statically.
 *
 * Because a `composite` may only contain `model` groups, the reference graph
 * is bipartite and a cycle is a type error, not merely a runtime hazard. The
 * guards in `index.js` cover the paths a hand-edited file can still take.
 *
 * The two knobs are orthogonal (see `strategy.js`): `strategy` decides the
 * order candidates are tried in, and `retry429` decides how many times one
 * candidate is retried after a rate limit. Both default to today's behavior —
 * sequential, no retry — so a document written before they existed keeps
 * working unchanged.
 *
 * Model entries are stored in the gateway's own exposed spelling
 * (`<provider>_<model>`, see `exposedModelId` in `index.js`), not in some new
 * format. That is what lets the router resolve a group's candidates with the
 * exact same code path it uses for a directly-named model.
 *
 * Storage lives beside the key store but in its own file. The key store's
 * owner-only permission rule exists because that file is a credential store;
 * group definitions carry no such secret and folding them in would blur that
 * rule for no benefit.
