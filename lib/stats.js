/**
 * Per-candidate call statistics for model groups.
 *
 * A group hides its members' health: the caller sees one name and the failover
 * loop silently walks past a dead candidate. This module keeps the scoreboard
 * the settings page needs to show which member is answering and which is not.
 *
 * ## What is counted, and what is deliberately not
 *
 * The unit is "did this candidate answer", not "did it succeed". A candidate
 * that produced output and then died mid-stream is counted as ANSWERED. That is
 * a real loss of information, accepted on purpose, and the reason is
 * structural rather than an oversight:
 *
 *  - On DSH's own path (`streamGroup`, an async generator) a post-output failure
 *    is still observable, because control returns to the loop on the next pull.
 *  - On the `/v1` path (`openStream`) the committed attempt is handed off as
 *    `resume(buffered, iterator)` and the failure then happens inside `resume`,
 *    where `openStream` can no longer see it.
 *
 * Counting only "answered" keeps one definition on both paths. Counting
 * "success" would make the two paths disagree, or force a wrapper around the
 * streaming hot path to make them agree. The honest naming is the trade:
 * `answered` / `refused`, never "success" / "failure".
 *
 * ## Failures that are not the candidate's fault
 *
 * A request that is too large, malformed, or cancelled fails the same way on
 * every candidate, so charging it to whichever one happened to be first would
 * blame a healthy model. Those land in `ignored` and never enter the ratio.
 *
 * ## Lifetime
 *
 * In memory only, and never persisted — the same discipline as the round-robin
 * cursor. Statistics are observability, not configuration: they must not be
 * able to affect routing, and a statistics update must never be able to fail a
 * request or delay a settings save. A restart starts the scoreboard over.
