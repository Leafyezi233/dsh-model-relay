/**
 * The DSH-facing half of dsh-model-relay: a provider whose models are groups.
 *
 * Registering this adapter is what makes a group selectable inside DSH itself,
 * not just over `/v1`. The adapter's model list *is* the group list, and a
 * stream for one of those models walks the group's candidates in order.
 *
 * It deliberately does not call the gateway's own `/v1` over HTTP even though
 * that is a valid way to reach the same routing logic. Going through the
 * loopback port would add a round trip, require `webServer` to be up before a
 * call could be dispatched, make the internal path depend on whatever
 * authentication `/v1` is currently enforcing, and behave differently behind a
 * reverse proxy. Calling `ctx.llm` directly avoids all four, and lets the exact
 * same failover routine back both entry points.
