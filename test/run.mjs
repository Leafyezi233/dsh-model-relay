/**
 * Run every suite, even when an earlier one fails.
 *
 * `npm test` used to chain the suites with `&&`, which meant a single failure
 * hid every suite after it — on Windows the LAN-address case fails for a
 * platform reason (`/proc/net/route` does not exist), so five of the six suites
 * never ran and the run looked far healthier than it was.
 *
 * Each suite is a separate process so one suite's state cannot leak into
 * another, and the exit code is non-zero if anything failed.
 *
 * Child output is redirected to a temporary file rather than a pipe. A pipe is
 * a named pipe on Windows, which some sandboxes refuse to create, and a
 * failure there would look like every suite crashing at once. A file has no
 * such restriction and behaves identically on every platform.
